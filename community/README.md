Community Detection
=======================

Run ```make``` to generate the required executables in each subdirectory, then run using the syntax explained in each markdown file.

This is an approximate version of community detection as discussion in our CRONO paper.

**Notes**

All inputs must be in powers of 2.
The executables also output the time in seconds that the program took to run.
The test folder includes a checker program, that checks for accuracy.
