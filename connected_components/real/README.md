Connected Components
=======================

Run ```make``` to generate the required executables, then run using the syntax explained below

Real World Graphs : connected_real.cc

**Real Graphs**

For real graphs, similarly compile connected_real.cc, then run using the input file, or any other file from the SNAP Suite,
```./connected_real 1 sample.txt```

**Notes**

All inputs must be in powers of 2.
The executables also output the time in seconds that the program took to run.
