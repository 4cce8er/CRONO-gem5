Triangle Counting
=================

Run ```make``` to generate the required executables, then use the syntax explained in each subdirectory (real,synthetic,test) to run the benchmark

**Notes**

All inputs must be in powers of 2.

The executable then outputs the time in seconds that the program took to run, as well as the number of triangles counted.
The test folder also contains a test program to check the parallel program's outputs.
