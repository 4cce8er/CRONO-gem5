PageRank
========

Run ```make``` within each folder (real,synthetic,test) to generate executables, then use the syntax explained in each README.md for the inputs

**Notes**

All inputs must be in powers of 2.

The test folder also compiles a test boost program that can be used to verify our PageRank programs.
