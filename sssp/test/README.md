TESTING FOR DIJKSTRA
====================

Testing : boost_dijk_real.cc

You can run ```make``` to create executables for each program or use the following commands below

**TESTING**

Compile boost_dijk_real.cc with it's MAKEFILE.  
Then Enter the <.exe> file named as boost_dijk_real with the grapgh input.

$ ./ <executable file> <graph input>

For Example;

$ make
$ ./boost_dijk_real roadNet-CA.txt

After complete execution, the testing code generates its own .txt file you can compare that file with the .txt file generated by the range_real.cc code.

**Limitations**

This Testing code is actually based on BOOST Algorithm which does not support anyother graph input other than "roadNet-CA.txt".

**Notes**

All inputs must be in powers of 2.

The executable then outputs the time in seconds that the program took to run.
This parallelization can handle negative edge weights as well.
The real world graphs version has a parameter P_max, that is specified by ```cuberoot(N)*3```, which specifies the number of iterations for the outer loop.
Unlike other Graph Processing Frameworks like Ligra and Boost, we do not pre-process graphs (e.g. compression, vertex/edge reordering), and hence have a more generic implementation.
